[color-fy](https://color-fy.vercel.app/) is a website that curates colour palettes extracted from new album covers from Spotify every week. The dominant colours on the covers are extracted using [coolors.](https://coolors.co/image-picker)

The project has two goals, firstly to provide color inspiration for developers and designers & secondly for visitors of the site to discover new music.

The site is built with Next.js on the front end and styled with Tailwind.

On the backend, the data is stored in a MongoDB database. Express.js has been used to set-up the server.
